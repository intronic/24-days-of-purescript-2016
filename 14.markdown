# 14. Go to Definition

Today's post is very brief, but I wanted to highlight a feature which was recently added to `psc-ide` - the ability to jump to the definition of the name under the cursor.

This feature is available in the editor plugins for Emacs, Vim, Atom and VS Code, but I'll show it here in Atom. Simply use the appropriate shortcut (Ctrl+âŒ˜+G on my Mac) while the cursor hovers over the name you want, or right-click, and select the Go to definition option from the PureScript submenu.

`psc-ide` keeps an index of all type constructors, data constructors, type classes, top-level values, etc. by their name, which makes this operation useful in lots of situations, and instantaneous!

In fact, it can even use this index of names to fix typos in your code. On the same menu, simply choose "Fix typo", and select from the available options:
