# 6. Pursuit Updates

Today, I'd like to briefly highlight some recent improvements in [Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org), the PureScript package database, and some related tools.

Pursuit was created by @hdgarrood during the Google Summer of Code in 2015, and it continues to be one of the community's best resources. You can find the source code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/purescript/pursuit).

## Recent Uploads

Recently, we added a list of the most recent uploads to the front page of Pursuit, so it's easy to see recent activity at a glance:

## Name Search

Pursuit has supported name search since the initial version. Do you ever find yourself knowing the name of a function you need, but can't remember the package it is defined in? You can easily find out by querying Pursuit.

For example, here are [the results of searching for `traverse`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/search?q=traverse).

Thanks to @kritzcreek's work on `psc-ide-server`, and the work of several others on editor plugins, we can also query Pursuit from inside our editors as well. For example, here is the same search inside Atom (thanks to the `atom-ide-purescript` by @nwolverson):

Similar editor plugins are available for Emacs, Vim and VS Code.

## Type Search

You can also search for functions by their type in Pursuit. The original version of type search used Hoogle behind the scenes, but that version was replaced recently by a custom implementation which uses the PureScript type information directly.

You can try it here, by [searching for the type of `traverse`](https://pursuit.purescript.org/search?q=%28a+-%3E+f+b%29+-%3E+t+a+-%3E+f+%28t+b%29).

## Conclusion

Pursuit is a great tool for PureScript developers, and it is being actively developed. Would you like to help out? Check out the issues on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/purescript/pursuit/issues)!
