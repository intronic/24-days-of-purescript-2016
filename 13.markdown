# 13. `psc-ide` - Add import

Continuing this week's theme of editor support in PureScript, today's post will look at `psc-ide`'s support for module imports. Today's post is a guest post by @kritzcreek, the author of `psc-ide`.

One of the most useful features of `psc-ide` is the ability to add imports for a given identifier. The examples I'll present will show the Emacs integration for `psc-ide`, but the same commands are available inside Atom, VSCode or Vim.

Given the following module the compiler will complain about a missing type `Maybe`, and unknown values `maybe` and `log`.
```haskell
module Main where

import Prelude

type Person = {name  :: String, title :: Maybe String }

showPerson :: Person -> String
showPerson p = 
  let
    title = maybe "" (_ <> " ") p.title
  in 
    title <> p.name
    
main = 
  log (showPerson {name: "Christoph", title: Just "Peasant"})
```

If we put our cursor on top of `Maybe` now and execute the `psc-ide-add-import` command `psc-ide` modifies our import section like so:

```haskell
import Prelude
import Data.Maybe (Maybe)
```

We can do the same for `maybe` and `log`, but for the `log` identifier we get a little pop-up asking us whether we meant `log` from `Control.Monad.Eff.Console` or `Math`.

We can choose the console log and end up with:

```haskell
import Prelude
import Control.Monad.Eff.Console (log)
import Data.Maybe (Maybe, maybe)
```

`psc-ide` extended the explicit imports from `Data.Maybe` and also sorts the imports which makes for less noise in git diffs. The last remaining problem is that the import for `Maybe` only imports the type and not its data constructors. When compiling the module now the compiler will complain about the unknown data constructor `Just`. Running the add import command one last time on `Just` extends the import for the `Maybe` type to also include its constructors like so:

```haskell
import Data.Maybe (Maybe(..), maybe)
```

While this is a massive improvement over manually searching for identifiers and managing the import section, `psc-ide` adding imports really shines when used in conjunction with auto-completion:
